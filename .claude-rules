# Claude Rules for YouTube Downloader Project

## Git Operations
- **NO AUTO COMMIT**: Do not automatically commit changes to git without explicit user request
- **NO AUTO PUSH**: Do not automatically push commits to remote repositories without explicit user request
- **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: Always ask for user confirmation before performing git operations
- **MANUAL WORKFLOW**: Let the user control their git workflow and timing

## Development Guidelines
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the project
- Use the existing test suite to verify changes work correctly
- Keep the modular architecture clean and organized
- Primary interface is the GUI application (src/gui/download_screen.py)

## Testing Requirements
- Run tests before suggesting changes are complete
- Use `PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest tests/ -v` for testing without asking for approval
- Ensure all 85 tests pass after making changes
- Test both GUI and CLI functionality when relevant

## Code Modifications
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Follow the established project structure in src/ directory
- Maintain the separation between core, config, and gui modules
- Keep utility functions in their appropriate modules
- Use direct imports from src/core modules (no compatibility wrapper)

## Documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md when making significant architectural changes
- Update README.md when changing user-facing features
- Keep documentation accurate and up-to-date with code changes
- Remove outdated references when functionality is removed

## Dependencies
- Only use the minimal required dependencies: yt-dlp and flet
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Keep requirements.txt clean and minimal
- Test that the project works with specified dependency versions

## User Interface
- Maintain the modern Material Design aesthetic in the GUI
- Ensure error messages are user-friendly and helpful
- Preserve the responsive design and proper error handling
- Keep the video player functionality working correctly

## Project Focus
- This is a YouTube video downloader with subtitle support
- No translation functionality - uses default subtitles only
- Focus on reliability, ease of use, and clean code
- Maintain the integrated video player and GUI features
